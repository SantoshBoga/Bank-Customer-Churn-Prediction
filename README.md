# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Abstract

The percentage or proportion of the companyâ€™s subscribers who pull out of a contract during the active period of a contract is called Customer Churn. 
This metric can be considered as an indication of customer discontent or the market competition with the current policies. 
Customer churn rate is well coupled with the customer lifetime within the company giving an approximation of the time the customer would stay in the company. 
Churn analysis plays a key role in decreasing the costs of customer addition as the price of adding a new customer to the business is pricier than retaining an existing one. 
Moreover, the revenue from a returning or existing customer would be comparatively higher than a new one. 
This piece of information can prove to be valuable in taking countermeasures to retain the customers.

The project focuses on - Predict customers likely to churn using supervised learning classification algorithms.

## Technology stack
*Programming languages & Libraries*: Python, keras, scikit-learn

*Technologies*: Machine Learning

*Miscellaneous* : Git, Anaconda

## Methodology
1. Analyzed the underlying distribution of the number of users who are about to leave the bank.
2. Predicted the churn customers using different supervised machine learning algorithms.
3. Performed sampling on the minority class to balance the dataset.
4. However, sampled dataset performed well and gave better accuracies and a better sensitivity score.
